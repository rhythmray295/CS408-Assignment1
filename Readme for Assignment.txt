- For the assignment, it does all the tasks apart from changing the particle direction.
- Please use the key R, G, B, r, g, b to change color. The control might feel a bit clunky upon first use, but all are functional
- For the arrow key directed options, please use the arrow keys on numpad, default arrow key function does not work properly
- Use H and h to change shape

That is all.

There is no creative addition, I will do better for the next assignment.
